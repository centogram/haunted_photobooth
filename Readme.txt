adapted from https://github.com/kenmickles/haunted_photobooth for Halloween party

Optimized use on OSX with imagesnap (brew install imagesnap).

Best if used in conjunction with a Griffin Powermate button.  Full screen the webapp on a big display and use an external camera connected via USB .  Allow guest to control using the big button only.  Photos sent directly to photo printer after snapping.
